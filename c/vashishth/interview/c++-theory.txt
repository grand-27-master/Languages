Q)diff. b/w structs and union?

A)struct sample		union sample
{			{
	int x;		   int x;
	char y;		   char y;	
}s;			}s;

in struct there are 2 memory blocks created (x&y),
while in union there is only 1 memory block (x or y).


Q)what is diff. b/w #include"..." & #include"<...>"?

A)#include"..." preprocessor looks for file to be included in same directory  where current source file is kept.


  #include"<...>"  preprocessor looks for file in directories pre-assigned by pc(std. libraries)


Q)what are dangling pointers & memory leaks?

A)dangling pointers points to locations which are already freed.
  
  memory leaks occur when locations aren't freed & there is no way to refer them.


Q)what is diff. b/w ++i & i++?

A) int x=10,y,z;

   y=++x;(11, increment before assigning)
   z=x++;(10,increment after assigning)


Q)what is diff. b/w "&" & "*"?

A)"*" points to a variable

  "&" gives address of variable

Q)what is "goto"?

A)"goto" is used to transfer flow to specific label or function(generally in loops)
  
  while(...)
  {
    ------;
    -------;
    goto func;
    --------;
  }
  
  void func(...)
  {
    ------;
  }


Q)what is extern and static func?

A)extern is in-built func(main())

  static is user defined func.

Q)what does int(*p)[10]; mean?

A)p is pointer to an array of 10 integers.

Q)what is diff. b/w new & malloc?

A)new initializes allocated memory by calling constructor and using delete keyword to delete.

  malloc allocates un-initialized memory and using free to delete.

Q)what is dynamic(or late) binding?

A) means that code associated with  given procedure call isn't known until time of call at run time.

Q)what is diff. b/w implicit and excplicit conversion?

A)implicit conversion is converting from small to large datatypes & vice versa.

Q)how can you re-allocate pointers?

A)by using re-alloc()

  str=(char*)malloc(10)
  str=(char*)realloc(str,20)
